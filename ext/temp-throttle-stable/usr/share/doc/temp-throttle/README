temp-throttle
=============

Linux shell script for throttling system CPU frequency based on a desired
maximum temperature (celsius).

Set a maximum temperature for your system using this script. If the maximum
temperature is exceeded, the script will limit the speed of your CPU cores
incrementally until the system is again below your desired maximum temperature.
(If your system remains above maximum temperature after completely limiting
your CPU cores, it will simply stay limited until temperatures drop below the
maximum desired.)


This script must be run with root privileges. Only Celsius temperatures
are supported. The configuration file is expected to be at
/etc/temp-throttle.conf

    sudo ./temp-throttle

Configuration file may be given eith the -c argument.

    sudo ./temp-throttle -c ./etc/temp-throttle.conf

More Instructions= see the included sample configuration file. Also see here:
